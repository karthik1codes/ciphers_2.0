# Wallet Address FAQ for Polygon Amoy

## ❓ Do I Need a Separate Polygon Wallet Address?

**No!** You don't need a separate "Polygon wallet address."

## ✅ How Wallet Addresses Work

### Same Address, Multiple Networks

Your MetaMask wallet address works on **all EVM-compatible networks**, including:

- ✅ Ethereum Mainnet
- ✅ Polygon Mainnet
- ✅ Polygon Amoy Testnet
- ✅ Mumbai Testnet (deprecated)
- ✅ BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, etc.

**Example:**
```
Your MetaMask Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb

This address works on:
- Ethereum: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
- Polygon: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
- Amoy: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
```

**The address is the same - only the network changes!**

## 🔑 How to Get Your Wallet Address

### From MetaMask:

1. **Open MetaMask extension**
2. **Click your account name** (top of MetaMask)
3. **Click to copy** your address
4. **Format:** `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`

### From Other Wallets:

- **Trust Wallet:** Settings → Wallet → Copy Address
- **Coinbase Wallet:** Settings → Wallet → Copy Address
- **Ledger/Trezor:** Use the address shown in the wallet app

## 💰 Getting Testnet MATIC on Amoy

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Copy your MetaMask address** (any network - it's the same address)
2. **Go to faucet:** https://faucet.polygon.technology/
3. **Select "Amoy" network**
4. **Paste your address** (the same one from MetaMask)
5. **Request testnet MATIC**
6. **Switch MetaMask to Amoy network** to see your balance

### Important Notes:

- ✅ **Use your MetaMask address** - no need for a separate Polygon address
- ✅ **Same address works** on all networks
- ✅ **Switch networks in MetaMask** to see balances on different chains
- ❌ **Don't create a new wallet** - use your existing MetaMask address

## 🌐 Understanding Networks vs Addresses

### Networks (Different Blockchains):
```
Ethereum Mainnet    → Chain ID: 1
Polygon Mainnet    → Chain ID: 137
Polygon Amoy       → Chain ID: 80002
```

### Addresses (Same Across Networks):
```
Your Address: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb

Works on:
- Ethereum Mainnet ✅
- Polygon Mainnet ✅
- Polygon Amoy ✅
- All EVM chains ✅
```

## 🔍 Verifying Your Address on Amoy

After getting testnet MATIC:

1. **Switch MetaMask to Amoy:**
   - Network: Polygon Amoy Testnet
   - Chain ID: 80002

2. **Check your balance:**
   - Should show: `0.5 MATIC` (or whatever you received)
   - Address shown is the same as on other networks

3. **View on explorer:**
   - Go to: https://amoy.polygonscan.com
   - Paste your address
   - See your balance and transactions

## ⚠️ Common Misconceptions

### ❌ Wrong: "I need a Polygon-specific wallet address"
**Correct:** Your MetaMask address works on Polygon and all EVM chains.

### ❌ Wrong: "I need to create a new wallet for Amoy"
**Correct:** Use your existing MetaMask wallet - just switch networks.

### ❌ Wrong: "My Ethereum address won't work on Polygon"
**Correct:** Same address works on both - they're both EVM-compatible.
